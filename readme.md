## Week 02:

    Finished the main structure of the index file, and matched what was asked on the good practice guide.

## Week 03:

    Added the CSS file and worked on the style of the index file in order to match the design made on Figma. Changed some parts of the HTML structure to made easier the design pattern of the whole document.

## Week 04:

    Added a new folder in  the main branch and created different css files, each one corresponding to a different section of the landing page. I also made the necessary changes in the HTML file to make it easier to implement media queries. Now the project is fully responsive and should be viewable from any device.

## Week 05:

    In this week assignment I've to make six differents types of JavaScript exercises, and include them in a new folder with a new index file. Then I've to link the different .js files that I created to that index file to be able to correctly visualize the exercises that I did. I have to demonstrate that the content shown in class and in the asynchronous material was understood and that it can be used correctly.

## Week 06:

    In this week assignment I've created the 'log in' and 'sign up' pages that we have made in Figma on the first week. I've made the necessary forms and also created the differens .js files to add the logic behind the forms. On top of that, I made some changes in the HTML file to make posible to navigate between the 3 pages(landing,log in, sign up).
